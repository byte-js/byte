# Tasks

## `IO`

Implement `IO` in functions like:

`read(<filepath>)` : Read a file

`write(<filepath>, <buffer>)` : Write buffer to a file

`get_file()` : Read a file from the internet

## `Command Line`

The `args()` has been having some bugs. Those have to be fixed.

## `Exec()`

The exec should take `arguments` for command like `exec("ls", "-l", "-a")`
and this execute the following command :

```bash
$ ls -l -a
```

## `Process`

`os()` : Output the operating system of the device

`homedir()` : The Home Dircetory of the device

`user()` : Returns the user of the machine

`cwd()` : Returns the Current Working Directory of the program

`base_cwd()` : Take an absolute path and output the base working directory

'color()` : Enter a rgb value and output the text in that color

## `Server-Side`

We have to implement server side programming and functions. We should start a localhost at http://localhost:5000/ and use req and res format to talk to the server

## `Import/Export`

We firstly have to decide a way to import and export files to share code and functions. Then we have to implement it . Preferably, we can create a function `export()` to export a file or a function, or a function `import()` to import a file
